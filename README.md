==========

Submiting cab jobs and template for scripts.



## Numbering, seeds, tests ##
* system:
    - seed is replaced (default value is 123456789)
    - 1010000 is base ( for respmcs was used: 1010000 for ct10nn, 1020000 for cteq66, 1010000 for ptshape)
    - adding numbers starting from 101 ( first is 1010101)
* tupleMaker3 introduced for 114 (all previous was buggy):
   - something went wrong with cab (for pt-shape)
   - resbos is working, pmcs is working, the problem is with CAB path
   - trying the same on cabsrv1 with pdf (no more time to wait)
   - when 114 is working we can make massive production

* tupleMaker3 without SAM 115:
* tupleMaker3 without SAM 116, disk exceeded issues
